# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

AutosRUs' newest protype, the MechaCar, is having production troubles and affecting the manufacturing team's progress.
Jeremy has been tasked by upper management to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.

### The following tasks have been identified to do:

1.	Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
2.	Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
3.	Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
4.	Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, you’ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.

# Results

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Since none of the coefficients or M value equals zero (0), the Ha hypothesis is true for all and thus there are no non-random amount of variance to the MPG values.
<br>
The p-value (5.35e-11) is less that the assumed significance level of 0.05%. Thus there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis and state that the slope of the linear model is NOT zero.
<br>
The r-squared value of 0.7149 or approximately 71% reveals the percentage of the data that fit the regression model. Although  this may be an acceptable prediction, a higher r-squared value is desirable.
